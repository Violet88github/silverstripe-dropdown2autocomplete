## Development Philosophy and Version Management ##

In contrast with most projects, the master is regularly chopped, altered, changed and improved.
This is not best practice, but it works for us.

While we regularly change the core, we try to keep API changes to a minimum and
we ensure that you can upgrade an e-commerce project from version 0.0001 to 99.0 without
much hassle.  For this purpose, we have written a build task that upgrades your database schema,
fixes data issues (e.g. adds defaults to new database fields), etc...

From time to time, we create a tag. This will usually coincide with a new version of Framework.
For example, when Framework tag 4.3.1 is released,
we may tag a version of the e-commercemaster as 4.3.1 at the same time.
From time to time, we also update the latest branch.

To make it work for you, in case you are working with the latest stable version of
the Silverstripe Framework, you just check out (fork) master, keep updating and working with it
until your projects is getting close to going live.  At that moment you lock e-commerce and
you only apply bug fixes where needed.

Next, when you get to update your clients Framework version you can choose to update e-commerce at the same time.
This will require you to retest the e-commerce functionality as we may have inadvertently broken something.

In terms of version numbering, we try to keep the tags and branch numbers synchronised with the
Silverstripe Framework versions.  This makes it easier to see what version is right for you
(e.g. ecommerce 3.1 should work well with the 3.1 branch of framework, etc...).


## Where the hell are the Unit Tests? ##

Right now, ecommerce does not have any php unit tests.
This is a major shortcoming that will be set right in due course.
We welcome contributions and/or donations to make this happen.
